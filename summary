A Linked Open Data infrastructure can have different characteristics:

 - central or distributed data storage 
 - central or distributed data indexing 
 - independent or cooperative data sources

Central Repository:

 - RDF data put into a single RDF store
 - Advantage: 
	 - Query evaluation can be implemented efficiently due to optimized index structures
	 - Original data sources are not involved in query evaluation
 - Disadvantage:
	 - If data at data sources changes frequently, data can become obsolete at central storage

Federation:

- Queries sent to a mediator which then executes query on behalf of user on the data sources
-  Mediator maintains global index with statistics
	- Used for sending queries to data sources and query optimizatron

Peer to Peer data management:

- Data and index data maintained in a distributed fashion
- no central mediator

Requirements of Federation Infrastructure
---------------------------------------------------

- Declarative language
	- concise formulation of complex queries
- Data catalogue
	- map query expressions to Linked Open Data sources
	- mappings are also needed between vocabularies in order to extend queries with similar terms
- Query Optimizer
	- optimize the query execution:
		- minimize processing cost and the communication cost involved 
- Data protocol
	- how queries and results are exchanged between data sources
	- e.g. SPARQL
- Provenance information
- Data changes at Data Sources: Data changes on Data Sources affect statistics and data entities which influences quality of the query optimization
- Scalability: implies two main challenges:
	- Efficient statistics management
	- effective query optimization and execution
|   |   |Central Repository   | Data source federation  |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Location  | local copies  | at data sources  |   |   |
| Meta data  | data statistics   | data source metadata  |   |   |
| Query processing  | local  | local+remote yes  |   |   |
| Require updates  |yes (data)   |yes (index)   |   |   |
| Complete results  |yes   |  yes |   |   |
| up-to-date results  | maybe  | yes  |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |

Statistics Management

- Accuracy vs. index size
- Updating statistics

Query Optimization and Execution

- execution order of query operators significantly influences the overall query evaluation cost

- Minimizing communication cost:
	- number of contacted data sources influences the performance of the query execution due to the communication overheads
	- Optimizing execution localization

Federator
------------
Responsible for:

- maintaining meta data about known data sources
- managing the whole query evaluation process

Actual query processing:

- query parsing
- query adaptation
- query mapping
	- selecting data sources
- query optimization
- query execution

Data Source Selection
---------------------------

- very likely that a single data source may only be able to return results for parts of the query
- respective query fragments have to be send to different data sources and the individual results have to be merged
